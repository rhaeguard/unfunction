    <h1>Learning by association</h1>

    

    

    <p>I have a method/strategy that I use to remember things. It is called <em>associative learning</em> which is when one stimulus can trigger another one. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">the experiment</a> Ivan Pavlov performed where the dog was conditioned to associate food with sound.</p>
<p>My method is not necessarily conditioning oneself to remember things, but more about remembering things together. This method can be useful in long-term activities such as learning a new language. It can also be useful in everyday scenarios. Let&rsquo;s cover the latter first. Say you have an appointment tomorrow and you are expected to bring a set of specific documents. While it&rsquo;s possible to pick up these documents tomorrow and before heading out, what I would do would be to gather all of them and put them right next to things I will definitely take such as my wallet and car keys. It is unlikely to forget all these items at the same time. What happens here is that we physically <em>associate</em> the documents with other important artifacts to increase the chance of recall.</p>
<p>Another way to use <em>associative learning</em> is in language learning. It becomes easier if you already know more than one language, but say you only know English and want to learn French. French and English share a lot of words, though they might have different meanings. Usually these meanings are not too far off. Anyway, say you see the word <strong>mur</strong> which means <strong>wall</strong>. You can memorize it, for sure, but a better way could be to remember it with the word <strong>mural</strong> in English which is an artwork painted directly on a <em>wall</em>. A couple more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>you might know <strong>arboreal</strong> has something to do with trees; well, <strong>arbre</strong> is a tree in French</li>
<li><strong>infirmary</strong> is a place where the sick receive treatment; <strong>infirmier</strong>/<strong>infirmi√®re</strong> is a nurse.</li>
<li>you may know that <strong>jaundice</strong> is associated with the color <strong>yellow</strong>; well <strong>jaune</strong> is the word for <strong>yellow</strong> in French.</li>
<li>Starbucks has the sizes Venti and Trenta which correspond to 20 and 30oz respectively. Well, those are the exact words to say 20 and 30 in Italian.</li>
</ul>
